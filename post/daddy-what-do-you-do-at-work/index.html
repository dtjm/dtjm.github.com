  <p><em>Talking with Boy #1 about his day before bedtime.<br />
They had 2 dentists come into class that day so he was really curious about what
I do at work&hellip;</em></p>

<pre><code>Boy 1: Daddy, what do you do at work? Do you do math?
Me:    Yeah, math and computer programming

Boy 1: How about English?
Me:    I have to write a lot, like emails and documentation and chats, 
       so I guess you could say I do English too
Boy 1: Like, you write sentences?
Me:    Yeah. A lot of sentences

Boy 1: Do you do drawing and coloring at work?
Me:    Yeah sometimes I have to draw pictures 
       and we use colors in the pictures. 
       And we have coloring books in the office too.

Boy 1: What about puzzles?
Me:    Yeah we have a lot of puzzles at work too!

Boy 1: What else do you do at work?
Me:    Well we have snack time and lunch time just like you.

Boy 1: Do you play after lunch?
Me:    Yeah sometimes we play ping-pong after lunch,
       some times we don't
Boy 1: We always play after lunch
</code></pre>

<p><em>Boy 1 quietly lays down in bed.<br />
5 minutes pass before he comes over to me:</em></p>

<pre><code>Boy 1: Do you do science and social studies too?
Me:    Yeah, well we use computer science but it's 
       not really a science
Boy 1: Oh, so just science only, no social studies? Ok bye
</code></pre>

<p><em>The next morning, this is the first thing he says to me:</em></p>

<pre><code>Boy 1: So, do you do spelling at work?
Me:    When I write I need to spell words correctly
Boy 1: But do you have spelling tests?
Me:    No, but if I don't spell words right, maybe someone
       will laugh at me.
Boy 1: If I worked at SendGrid, nobody would laugh at me
       because I'm a good speller
