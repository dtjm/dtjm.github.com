title: Choosing Collaborative Workspace Environment
---

When I was assigned with researching and implementing a collaborative workspace environment, I didn't find much pre-digested material out there. I hope this roundup benefits you.

*Scenario*
A group of about 10-15 businessmen are collaborating on a new project. They are all very, very busy people, with average technical aptitude and plenty of business savvy. My assignment: create a place where this group can conduct organized, traceable, collaborative research (no e-mailing PDFs and URLs back and forth). This includes storage for primary sources (PDFs and e-mails), a system for sharing insights or conclusions from those primary sources, and ultimately, the facility to take this research and turn it into the basis for collaborating on the documentation for a business plan.

*Requirements*
I had to find a platform that *balanced functionality and usability*. To make this as user-friendly as possible, I would have to find an *e-mail-friendly* platform, since the participants were mainly e-mail users. I also wanted to go with a *hosted solution* to avoid the headache of managing my own installation and servers.

After browsing through nine or ten collaborative workspace environments, I narrowed the choices down to four: Basecamp, Central Desktop, Groove, and SocialText. Here are my notes on each of the four (in relation to our needs):

*<a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">37signals' Basecamp</a>*

Basecamp is a lightweight web-based collaboration environment that appears to be geared toward small to medium development teams.

Pros: <ul>
	<li>Simple, clean interface</li>
</ul>
Cons: <ul>
	<li>Writeboard, their document system, only supported basic rich text and no table</li></ul>
Choose Basecamp if you nead a clean, lightweight environment to keep tasks organized, but not if you need access to a lot of rich centralized information.

*<a href="http://centraldesktop.com/">Central Desktop</a>*<img style="float:right;margin-left:1em;" src="http://tech.fileglobber.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/logo.thumbnail.gif" alt="Central Desktop Logo" />
Central Desktop is a large, corporate, heavily-marketed, web-based collaborative workspace environment.

Pros:
<ul>
	<li>Full-featured</li>
	<li>Full-text search of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF</li>
	<li>Can receive files by e-mail and carry archived discussions through e-mail</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
	<li>Complex interface -- possible resistance to adoption because of high learning curve</li>
</ul>
Central Desktop is a good choice as long as users can adopt it and someone is available to train them.


*<a href="http://www.groove.net/home/index.cfm">Groove</a>*<img src="http://tech.fileglobber.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/logo1.thumbnail.gif" alt="Groove Logo" style="float:right;margin-left:1em;border:1px solid #222;" />
Groove is a desktop application that creates a virtual group space in which you can collaborate on desktop-based documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). It integrates communication features like chat to facilitate collaboration. Functionality is separated into discrete "tools" that the workspace manager adds at his own discretion.

Pros:
<ul>	<li>It is geared toward a desktop environment, so users won't have to learn new software; they can use their existing applications</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
	<li>Expensive! $209 per machine</li>
	<li>Doesn't appear to safely manage data. If you delete a tool then it's gone forever and the data with it.</li>
	<li>No document versioning</li>
</ul>
Groove is nice if your users need to use desktop applications.

*<a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a>*
<img style="float:right;margin-left:1em;" src="http://tech.fileglobber.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/header_logo.thumbnail.png" alt="SocialText Logo" />
SocialText is a web-based wiki environment. Almost all functionality is accomplished by manipulating wiki pages.

Pros:
<ul>
	<li>Simple interface</li>

</ul>
Cons: <ul>
	<li>No calendar</li>
	<li>No proper file repository</li>
</ul>
Use SocialText if your want to collaborate mainly over text, and you won't be uploading a lot of files.

*Conclusion*
Each of these applications has its own niche, and I ended up choosing Central Desktop as the one that fit us the best. One of the biggest factors was the full-text Google search in workspace files and documents. I know that our users will need to use the search tool to find information within the workspace.
