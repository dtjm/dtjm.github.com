title: "“ImportError: No module named rhn” when upgrading from RHEL3 to RHEL4"
---

I was getting this error when trying to run *up2date *after upgrading Red Hat Enterprise Linux from v3 to v4:
@> up2date-nox
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/sbin/up2date-nox", line 27, in ?
    from up2date_client import repoDirector
  File "/usr/share/rhn/up2date_client/repoDirector.py", line 5, in ?
    import rhnChannel
  File "/usr/share/rhn/up2date_client/rhnChannel.py", line 10, in ?
    import up2dateAuth
  File "/usr/share/rhn/up2date_client/up2dateAuth.py", line 5, in ?
    import rpcServer
  File "/usr/share/rhn/up2date_client/rpcServer.py", line 23, in ?
    from rhn import rpclib
ImportError: No module named rhn@
The solution was to reinstall *rhnlib-1.8.2-1.p23.1.noarch.rpm* and  *up2date-4.4.67-4.i386.rpm*. Be sure to install those exact versions, since what RHEL4 installs is newer and broken for some reason. Then, when you run _up2date -u_, up2date will upgrade itself properly. You can get the RPMs through the RHN web interface.
