I'm around Genesis 10 and it has already been pretty exciting.  If you want to follow along, you can see the verses that I have noted: <a href="http://ebible.com/bookmarks/person/technology/dtjm">my technology verses at eBible.com</a>

On the web I found only *1* substantial piece of writing on this topic. You can find it here: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mflabar/Technology.htm">Scripture on the use of technology</a>. Let me know if you know any leading thought on the Biblical viewpoint on technology.
