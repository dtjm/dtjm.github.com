title: MacBook with 1.5GB Unmatched RAM Crashes
---

Picked up my MacBook from the Apple Store today, booted it up, and as soon as I clicked on the Airport icon to turn it on, my computer froze with the instructions to shut down my computer in 4 languages.

I shut down, booted up, and as soon as it started loading the operating system, it gave me the same fatal error message.

*Fix*
Hold down the Alt/Option key while booting up to get into Boot Camp. Startup Windows, then restart the computer and it's as good as new!

But Parallels is still slow. What's a good amount of memory to dedicate to Windows XP under Parallels?
