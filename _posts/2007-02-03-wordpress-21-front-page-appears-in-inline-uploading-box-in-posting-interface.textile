title: "Wordpress 2.1: Front Page Appears In Inline Uploading Box in Posting Interface"
---

After upgrading to Wordpress 2.1 on FileGlobber, I was having some weird bug in the posting interface where the front page of my site was appearing in an IFRAME where the inline uploader should have been.

After digging through some PHP and HTML, I determined that <a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/">Silas Partners' Flickr Photo-Album Plugin</a> was was incompatible with the new WordPress. They have a new version (released Jan 30 2007) ready for WP 2.1.
