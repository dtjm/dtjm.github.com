title: Genesis 4:17-22 — Cities, tents, music, and metalwork 
---

This passage is packed with new industry:
bq. Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he *built a city*, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech .<span class="verse-num">..</span> Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in *tents* and have livestock. His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the *lyre and pipe*. <span class="verse-num"> </span>Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of *bronze and iron*.
First of all, you now have cities, which at the most basic level are probably a collection of tents.  Having tents implies a knowledge of making fabrics or perhaps using branches and leaves to create a basic building structure.  The mention of the lyre and pipe implies that they know the process of creating such instruments, which likely required fine wood and metalwork skills.  Finally, they introduced bronze and iron industrial processes.

I'm seeing pattern here of how technology fits into Scripture: it just happens!  There's no technical backgrounding, it's just there, as though it were always there.  It's nothing new.
