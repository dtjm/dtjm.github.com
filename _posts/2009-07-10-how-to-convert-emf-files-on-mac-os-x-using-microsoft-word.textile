title: How to convert EMF files on Mac OS X using Microsoft Word

<ol>
	<li>Drag the image into a blank Word document</li>
	<li>Right-click on the image</li>
	<li>Click _Save as picture..._</li>
</ol>

That will let you save it as a PNG, PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF.

This worked on Word 2008 for Mac and OS X 10.5.7.
