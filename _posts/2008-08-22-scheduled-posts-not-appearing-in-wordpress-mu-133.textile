title: Scheduled posts not appearing in Wordpress MU 1.3.3
---

We were having issues of scheduled posts not appearing at the scheduled time
WordPress MU 1.3.3

We tried adding this snippet in wp-includes/cron.php:
bq. 
<pre>fflush($argyle);
fgets($argyle);
fclose($argyle);</pre>


Which was only half of the problem.

What happened in our setup was that our machine that was hosting our WordPress installation could not access the site properly from the machine itself due to improper DNS settings

So here's what I did:
<ol>
	<li>SSH into the machine which is hosting WordPress.</li>
	<li>Attempt to access the site using `lynx http://example.com/`.
This showed me that I couldn't get to the site from the host itself, and therefore couldn't execute the wp-cron.php script.</li>
	<li>At this point I looked at the Apache configuration and realized that the virtual host for our WordPress installation was only listening on the public IP interface, not the localhost.
The /etc/hosts was pointing example.com to the localhost interface, which made me see the default Apache web site when I tried to access http://example.com</li>
	<li>So I had to change /etc/hosts to make sure that example.com would resolve to the public IP interface.</li>
</ol>
The end!
