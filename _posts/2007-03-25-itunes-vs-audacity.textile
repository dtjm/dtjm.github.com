title: iTunes vs. Audacity
---

Today I tried using Audacity (an audio editing program) to record a part of a podcast I bought through iTunes. As soon as Audacity opened, *my entire Windows audio subsystem started to make ALL my audio sound like demons*. I couldn't get a good recording of it. iTunes _somehow knows_ that I am going to rip a song off and it goes through Windows to stop me.

After I closed Audacity and restarted iTunes, everything started to work again.

Well-played, Apple. But I know <a href="http://www.answers.com/DRM">DRM</a> is not in your heart, and you will find a way to be free.
