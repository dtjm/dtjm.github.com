Looks like you can <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306060" title="Apple.com">send Keynote presentations directly to YouTube</a>. Could be a great convenience for sharing presentations.

UPDATE

Actually, when you export to YouTube, Keynote doesn't include any transitions...too bad. Looks like Flash export is the way to go for now.
