I made it sound cheesier than it really is.

I just listened to Neil Gershenfeld from MIT talk about fabrication, design, and all sorts of amazing applications. The coolest thing, though, was when he talked about nano-computers that stored information in them similar to how DNA stores information internally. It's fascinating to see man-made things move closer to things God has already designed.
