*Talking with Boy #1 about his day before bedtime...*

```
Boy 1: Daddy, what do you do at work? Do you do math?
Me:    Yeah, math and computer programming
Boy 1: How about English?
Me:    I have to write a lot, like emails and documentation and chats, 
       so I guess you could say I do English too
Boy 1: Like you write sentences?
Me:    Yeah. A lot of sentences

Boy 1: Do you do drawing and coloring at work?
Me:    Yeah sometimes I have to draw pictures 
       and we use colors in the pictures. 
       And we have coloring books in the office too.

Boy 1: What about puzzles?
Me:    Yeah we have a lot of puzzles at work too!

Boy 1: What else do you do at work?
Me:    Well we have snack time and lunch time just like you.
Boy 1: Do you play after lunch?
Me:    Yeah sometimes we play ping-pong or Pac-Man after lunch, some times we don't
Boy 1: We always play after lunch

*...Boy 1 lays down in bed....*

*...5 minutes pass and he comes over to me...*

```
Boy 1: Do you do science and social studies too?
Me:    Yeah, well we use computer science but it's not really a science
Boy 1: Oh, so just science only, no social studies? Ok bye
