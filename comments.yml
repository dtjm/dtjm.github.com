  You must manually install up2date, (up2date-gnome) and rhnlib. The package has not been automatically installed because your el3 up2date package has a higher version number than the one on your el4 CD set. Though they have higher version numers, they don't support el4.
  
  use 'rpm -Uvh --oldpackage ' to force a "downgrade" to lower version of the packages from you disk set, that supports el4.

  If anyone still monitors this. For you to really see how much God's word speaks of technology. We would have to know simple definitions. The bible says alot on this matter of technology. So if I were to swing to the other end of the scripture, say Revelation, where the woman rides the beast. Ok. Our definitions have not changed just what we call things. God's definitions have not changed. He's the Word. Just a thought to think about. Could that woman be a Motherboard (like in a computer). As I keep a close watch. Her popularity has run wild though out the world right under people's noses. She is very powerful. So much so the general public has no idea. Take the 3 fastest computers in the world. One's name is Legion.  Another's ones name is the meaning of 'they move in smoke and mirrors', Cloud.
  
  I know I sound crazy.
  
  I would like to hear some more of your thoughts.
  
  Kindly,
  Jason

content: Hi Jason, to be honest, yes you do sound crazy.  What I am looking to do is flip it around and look at technology starting in Genesis.  What kind of technology did Adam and Noah and Abraham use?  Lets take a hundred steps back from high-tech and look at tech from its beginnings, be it weapons, vehicles, or processes for converting resources into tools and artifacts.  How did characters in the Bible use and think about their technology?  How does God think about it?

  Technology will outsmart humans and create scientific breakthroughs.  The intelligence of the collective machine mind will be far superior than that of humans,  This will happen in the next 20 years.  We will worship this new thing.  We will need it.  It will become a god.  It will be amazing.  This artificial intelligence will be the Antichrist.
  
  A little later, this same technology will begin entering humans.  It's inevitable, its evolution. It's what will happen.  This is when the 2nd christ will come.  The Christ must be of human.
  
  Of course vice versa is a possibility.

content: I think it depends on which version of the dv you have as to whether or not Subversion is installed as part of the Developer Tools installation. I know it's there for dv 3.5. Best to check beforehand.

  It appears that this cannot be done using Server Admin and Workgroup Manager, but it may be possible using edquota (which I have never used, but saw <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107701" rel="nofollow">something on it here</a>)
  
  Workgroup Manager has a place to set disk quotas for a user, but I think that is only for the home directory.
  
  Server Admin has a place to turn on quotas (in the File Sharing tab), but you can't control the quotas from there. So I can turn on quotas for my Time Machine disk but I cannot change them in Server Admin.

content: This worked for me but for a different/similar problem.  Users with roaming profiles were getting errors when logging out.  When the copy process would hit certain *.url files stored in the favorites folder it would fail.  No strange permissions or anything, it would say it was unable to update the given file because of network or permission problems.  There would be a long space after that followed by a detail, saying there wasn't enough space on the disk to write the file. (multiple Gigs were in fact available).
