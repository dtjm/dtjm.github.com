      <description>Talking with Boy #1 about his day before bedtime.
They had 2 dentists come into class that day so he was really curious about what I do at work&amp;hellip;
Boy 1: Daddy, what do you do at work? Do you do math? Me: Yeah, math and computer programming Boy 1: How about English? Me: I have to write a lot, like emails and documentation and chats, so I guess you could say I do English too Boy 1: Like, you write sentences?</description>
